# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in Tag

This repository demonstrates a subtle but impactful error in HTML: a simple typo in an HTML tag.  While not immediately flagged by the browser as a major error, this typo causes unexpected behavior in how the content is rendered.

The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code, showcasing the issue.  The `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code, with the typo fixed.

This illustrates how careful attention to detail is crucial in HTML development, as even minor mistakes can lead to significant visual inconsistencies.  Such issues might not generate explicit console errors, making them tricky to detect without careful visual inspection of the rendered page.
